# IocKata
A coding kata to build a simple Inversion of Control (IoC) container.

## Introduction

Cloning the repository will get you the starting skeleton, a single project with two classes, one for the IoC container itself, and one for its tests. The tests are writtern using NUnit since it is still the most widely-known unit testing library, and the basis of all others.

The repository contains multiple branches, one for each completed step of the kata.
